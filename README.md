# 👋 Hi, I'm Deepak Deo  

🎓 **PhD in Physics (Astrophysics)** | 💻 **Data Scientist** | 📊 **Machine Learning Enthusiast**

## ✨ About Me  
I'm a data-driven problem solver with a PhD in Astrophysics and a passion for transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. My research on *galaxy evolution and quenching mechanisms* taught me to handle large-scale, noisy datasets — skills I now apply to data science, ML, and analytics challenges across diverse domains.  
Currently, I’m focused on building **end‑to‑end ML pipelines**, **ETL workflows**, and **interactive dashboards** that bring data to life.
